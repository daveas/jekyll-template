# Rig

**Purpose:** Rig is meant to be a versatile starting point for anyone creating a site using Jekyll, no matter the size of your site or its purpose. Rig comes with tons of prefilled options and examples for writing posts, creating collections, and displaying data.

**Philosophy:** Rig is built to work on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and therefore avoids reliance on plugins. Instead, Rig opts to rely more heavily on [Liquid Markup](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics) and stock [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) parts. Rig also comes without the weight of jquery or other javascript libraries and instead focuses on getting the most out of CSS & HTML. These features make Rig particularly useful for designers who prefer not to touch code or to those just beginning to code. For more advanced users who want to use plugins with gh-pages, I recommend [this method](http://arademaker.github.io/blog/2011/12/01/github-pages-jekyll-plugins.html). Or you can serve your own gh-pages style site, using [this method](https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook).

**Namesake:** On a sailboat, the "Rig" refers to how the boats sails are set up. Different boats have different arrangements depending on their size and purpose.<br><img src="http://www.alberg30.org/boat/A30sailplan.jpg" alt="rig" width="20%;"/>
